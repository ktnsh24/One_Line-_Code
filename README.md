# One Line Code for Data Examination

### Introduction


Whenever we start to examine any dataset. We generally take a look at **Shape of the data, Top, Bottom and Random Sample of the observations, Data type, data statistics and the missing values** available in the dataset. In order to examine everything I mentioned, we have to write some code, specifically finding the data missing percentage. I try to make this code. With this, a user can just run this one line of code in their IPython session and can examine without writing any other code. Below, I have described step by step procedure to run this code.  

The code will help user's to examine their data by just running this external code. By running this external code, a user can examine,

* [The shape of the data](#The-shape-of-the-data)
* [Top observations of the data](#Top-observations-of-the-data)
* [Bottom observations of the data](#Bottom-observations-of-the-data)
* [Random observations of the data](#Random-observations-of-the-data)
* [Choice of the observations from the data](#Choice-of-the-observations-from-the-data)
* [Data type of the all features and target variables](#Data-type-of-the-all-features-and-target-variables)
* [Summary statistics of the dataset variables](#Summary-statistics-of-the-dataset-variables)
* [Total missing value percentage of the dataset](#Total-missing-value-percentage-of-the-dataset)
* [Missing values sum and percentage in each observation](#Missing-values-sum-and-percentage-in-each-observation)
