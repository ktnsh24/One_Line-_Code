# One Line Code for Data Examination

### Introduction


Whenever we start to examine any dataset. We generally take a look at **Shape of the data, Top, Bottom and Random Sample of the observations, Data type, data statistics and the missing values** available in the dataset. In order to examine everything I mentioned, we have to write some code, specifically finding the data missing percentage. I try to make this code. With this, a user can just run this one line of code in their IPython session and can examine without writing any other code. Below, I have described step by step procedure to run this code.  

The code will help user's to examine their data by just running this external code. By running this external code, a user can examine,

* [The shape of the data](#The-shape-of-the-data)
* [Top observations of the data](#Top-observations-of-the-data)
* [Bottom observations of the data](#Bottom-observations-of-the-data)
* [Random observations of the data](#Random-observations-of-the-data)
* [Choice of the observations from the data](#Choice-of-the-observations-from-the-data)
* [Data type of the all features and target variables](#Data-type-of-the-all-features-and-target-variables)
* [Summary statistics of the dataset variables](#Summary-statistics-of-the-dataset-variables)
* [Total missing value percentage of the dataset](#Total-missing-value-percentage-of-the-dataset)
* [Missing values sum and percentage in each observation](#Missing-values-sum-and-percentage-in-each-observation)

### Guidence required

Hello Everyone, this is something I did because I'm trying to improve my python skills. I beleive there could be some fault in my code or any mistake. I will appreciate your response and view on it. If you think there is possibility to improve this code. Please help me with your guidence. 

If you want to use this code, you are allowed to use it with appropriate reference. 

### Step 1 (Most Important one)
As different user titled their data frame differently but my code only understands one title name "dataset". So In order to use my code you need to do thisðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡.

Or if you don't want to do this just titled your data frame as the 'dataset'. Like this ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡
